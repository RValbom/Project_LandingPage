			<p><em>Portugal - France (July 5, 2024)</em></p>

			<p>In the Euro 2024 quarter-final match between Portugal and France, held on July 5, 2024, the game ended in a dramatic penalty shootout after a goalless draw through regular and extra time. France emerged victorious, winning 5-3 on penalties.</p>
			
			<p>Throughout the match, both teams had several opportunities to score but were denied by strong defensive performances and excellent goalkeeping. Portugal's Bruno Fernandes had a significant chance in the 60th minute, but his shot was saved by French goalkeeper Mike Maignan. Cristiano Ronaldo and Vitinha also came close but couldn't convert their chances. France had notable attempts as well, including a close-range shot from Eduardo Camavinga that went wide and a last-minute save from Diogo Costa against Kylian Mbappe. Extra time saw Ronaldo miss another critical chance, and France's Dayot Upamecano made a crucial block against Rafael Leao.</p>
			
			<p>In the penalty shootout, France was flawless, scoring all five of their penalties. Portugal, however, faltered when Joao Felix's shot hit the post. Cristiano Ronaldo, Bernardo Silva, and Nuno Mendes scored their penalties for Portugal, but it wasn't enough to overcome France's perfect record in the shootout. This victory propelled France into the semi-finals, where they will face Spain.</p>
